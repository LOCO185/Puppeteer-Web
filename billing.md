## UI mock-up, problems and issues

1. The currency of the payment is not given.
2. The Security Code of the Visa card should be required.
3. This billing is only for United States because of "select a state" drop down.
4. There's no information about the product we are paying for.
5. Need to check that the dropdowns is valid, and it doesn't have expired dates.
6. Unnecessary spaces between the fields of the "Cardholder Name".
7. Unsightly colors.

## Validation

1. Postal Code validation for the selected state.
2. Card Number validation (16 digits, no dashes, spaces, letters).
3. Card Type validation (every credit company has it's own first 4 digits).

## Usability

1. it should have a good seperating between the fields. for example,
   the "First Name" input not clear if it's for the Cardholder or the buyer.
2. Why there's two fields for "Billing Street Address".
